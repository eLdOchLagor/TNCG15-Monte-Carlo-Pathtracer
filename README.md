This is a Monte-Carlo raytracer made for the course TNCG15 at LIU. It includes Diffuse surfaces, mirrors and transparent objects, aswell as light sources. The Final render is from a version without photonmapping, however there is a later version that includes it, but we didn't get it to work correctly.
